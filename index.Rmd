### **I am..** 

<font size="3"> 

I'm a postdoctoral reesarch scholar at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I'm interested in understanding children's cognition and brain development with a focus on investigating how educational experience molds children’s brains and vice versa. 

My path to discovering my passion for investigating learner's mind and brain with the goal of improving children’s education was unconventional. I studied physics as an undergraduate, but turned to cognitive science for my Masters, which led me to enter the field of numerical cognition. This diverse background led me to embrace an interdisciplinary approach, and into the field of educational neuroscience. 

I'm investigating the development of nonsymbolic ratio representations and following structural and fuctional brain changes. But more specifically, I would like to focus more on the changes in structural connectivity and its relation with children's learning abilities (ex. math and language). I do believe different educational experiences shape kid's brain differently! 

I love wine, yoga, and netflix.
