<font size="3"> Hello! 

I'm a graduate student at UW-Madison interested in children's cognition and brain development in the context of education. Especially, I'm interested in the development of nonsymbolic ratio representations and following structural and fuctional brain changes. I do believe different educational experiences shape kid's brain differently! 


I love yoga, netflix, and chocolate. </font>
